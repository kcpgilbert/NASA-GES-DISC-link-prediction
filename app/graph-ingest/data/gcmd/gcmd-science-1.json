Microfossils are a heterogeneous bunch of fossil remains studied as a single discipline because rock samples must be processed in certain ways to remove them and microscopes must be used to study them. Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. \n\nMicrofossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.",

The monsoons are strongest on the southern and eastern sides of Asia, the largest landmass, but monsoons also occur on the coasts of tropical regions wherever the planetary circulation is not strong enough to inhibit them.

It usually occurs in combination\r\nwith plant sugars. The tuberous edible plant of the spurge family called\r\ncassava (also known as manioc, mandioc, or yuca) was used by primitive peoples\r\nto produce HCN for poison darts and arrows. HCN is produced by other plants,\r\nbacteria and fungi. Emissions from CN radicals are occasionally observed from\r\nlightning disturbed air. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by biomass burning since\r\nnitrogen in plant material is mostly present as amino acids and upon combustion\nthis nitrogen is emitted as a variety of compounds including NH3, NO, NO2, N2O,\norganic nitriles and nitrates. It is interesting to note that the atmospheric\r\nmeasurements of HCN reported by Zander et al. (1988) gave a mixing ratio for\r\nHCN in the Southern Hemisphere which was approximately 5% higher than that for\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere. This may be due to biomass burning.\r\nThere are many anthropogenic sources of compounds containing CN which can be\r\nreleased into the atmosphere. Cyanides are used in a variety of chemical\r\nprocesses including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel,\r\nelectroplating and in the concentration of ores. Hydrogen cyanide is used to\r\nprepare polyacrylonitrile fibres (known by the generic name of acrylic)\r\nsynthetic rubber, plastics, and in gas masers to produce a wavelength of 3.34\r\nmm. Hydrogen cyanide is a combustion product which is a human hazard during\r\ndomestic and industrial fires and from tobacco smoking. Some catalytic\r\nconverters in bad repair can produce large amounts of Hydrogen cyanide.\r\nHydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities for laboratory and commercial\r\nuse by three principle methods: Treatment of sodium cyanide with sulphuric\r\nacid, catalytic oxidation of a methane-ammonia mixture, and decomposition of\r\nformamide (HCONH2).",

EPA is concerned about particles that are 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller because those are the particles that generally pass through the throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects. EPA groups particle pollution into two categories: \n\u003cBR\u003e\n- \u0027Inhalable coarse particles,\u0027 such as those found near roadways and dusty industries, are larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter.\n\u003cBR\u003e\n- \u0027Fine particles,\u0027 such as those found in smoke and haze, are 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller.

High ground-level ozone amounts contribute to poor air quality, adversely affecting human health, agricultural productivity, and forested ecosystems. Ozone absorbs infrared radiation, and is most potent as a greenhouse gas in the cold upper troposphere located 8–15 km above the surface. In the stratosphere, between approximately 15 and 50 km above the Earth’s surface, a layer rich in ozone serves as a “sunscreen” for the world by shielding the Earth’s surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation. This absorption of solar energy also affects atmospheric circulation patterns and thus influences weather around the globe. Moreover, throughout the atmosphere, ozone is the key ingredient that initiates chemical cleansing of the atmosphere of various pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and methane, among others, which could otherwise accumulate to harmful levels or exert a stronger influence on climate. Therefore, changes to ozone anywhere in the atmosphere can have major impacts on the Earth.",

          "text": "The East Atlantic (EA) pattern is the second prominent mode of low-frequency variability over the North Atlantic, and appears as a leading mode in all months. The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a “southward shifted” NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).\n\nThe positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.\n\nThe EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004. The positive phase of the EA pattern was particularly strong and persistent during 1997-2004, when 3-month running mean values routinely averaged 1.0-2.0 standard deviations above normal.",

With the addition\nof other components (such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration\nover land), the AOGCM becomes the basis for a full climate model. \r\nSome recent models include the biosphere, carbon cycle and atmospheric\nchemistry as well. AOGCMs can be used for the prediction and rate of change of\nfuture climate. They are also used to study the variability and physical\nprocesses of the coupled climate system. Global climate models typically have a\nresolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate projections from the Hadley\nCentre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its successor\nHadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have\nusually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but\nif a carbon cycle model is included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon\ndioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon dioxide into the\natmosphere. Similarly, an AOGCM coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is\nable to predict the changes in concentration of other atmospheric constituents\nin response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases.\nFurther information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3\n(thermohaline circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability\nin the ocean of HadCM3.\r\nRecently a global coupled climate model with an eddy-permitting ocean\nresolution has been developed at the Hadley Centre, in order to better\nrepresent important oceanic processes.",

They are found along the seaward margin of most\r\nabyssal plains and originate from the spreading of mid-ocean ridges. As such,\r\nthey usually form two strips parallel to mid-ocean ridges.

These were formed by turbidity currents which covered the\r\npreexisting topography. Most abyssal plains are located between the base of the\ncontinental rise and the abyssal hills.

The hydrosphere includes water that is on the surface of the planet, underground, and in the air. A planet\u0027s hydrosphere can be liquid, vapor, or ice.\n\nOn Earth, liquid water exists on the surface in the form of oceans, lakes and rivers. It also exists below ground—as groundwater, in wells and aquifers. Water vapor is most visible as clouds and fog.\n\nThe frozen part of Earth\u0027s hydrosphere is made of ice: glaciers, ice caps and icebergs. The frozen part of the hydrosphere has its own name, the cryosphere. \n\nWater moves through the hydrosphere in a cycle. Water collects in clouds, then falls to Earth in the form of rain or snow. This water collects in rivers, lakes and oceans. Then it evaporates into the atmosphere to start the cycle all over again. This is called the water cycle.\u0027",

These regions capture the largest precipitation anomalies associated with the interannual variations of the Walker circulation and contain the largest correlations between GPCP and Nino 3.4 and SOI. Within P and MC the absolute magnitude of the largest correlation is over +0.6. \n\nBecause of the spatially varying nature of rainfall, it was decided to use a moving block average which would capture the strongest zonal gradients within the equatorial Pacific. This procedure is unlike many fixed area average indices, and allows for a realistic meridional component of the precipitation gradient and migration of the ascending and descending branches of the Walker circulation.",

It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of minus numbers; for example, minus 2 is moderate drought, minus 3 is severe drought, and minus\n4 is extreme drought. The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculating\nshort-term abnormal dryness or wetness affecting agriculture. CMI is designed to indicate normal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season; it uses the same levels as the Palmer Drought Index. It differs from the Palmer Index in that the formula places less weight on the data from previous weeks and more weight on the recent week.",

The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance the\ngreenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing to\nthe warming of Earth\u0027s lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory)\r\nThe most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations\nfor periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas\ninclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widely\naccepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate\nthat atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260¿280uL/L immediately before\nindustrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the\npreceding 10,000 years. \r\nThe longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has been\nsampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 years\nbefore the present.

PDO has since\r\nbeen described as a long-lived El Nino-like pattern of Pacific\r\nclimate variability because the two climate oscillations have similar\r\nspatial climate fingerprints, but very different temporal behavior.\r\nTwo main characteristics distinguish PDO from El Nino/ Southern\r\nOscillation (ENSO): first, 20th century PDO \u0027events\u0027 persisted for\r\n20-to-30 years, while typical ENSO events persisted for 6 to 18\r\nmonths; second, the climatic fingerprints of the PDO are most visible\r\nin the North Pacific/North American sector, while secondary signatures\r\nexist in the tropics - the opposite is true for ENSO.\r\nSeveral independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles\r\nin the past century: \u0027cool\u0027 PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and\r\nagain from 1947-1976 while\u0027warm\u0027 PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946\r\nand from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990\u0027s.

During winter and spring, the pattern consists of a north-south dipole of anomalies, with one center located over the Kamchatka Peninsula and another broad center of opposite sign covering portions of southeastern Asia and the low latitudes of the extreme western North Pacific. Therefore, strong positive or negative phases of this pattern reflect pronounced zonal and meridional variations in the location and intensity of the entrance region of the Pacific (or East Asian) jet steam. \n\nIn the summer and fall, the WP pattern becomes increasingly wave-like, and a third prominent center appears over Alaska and the Beaufort Sea, with a sign opposite to the center over the western North Pacific. This wave structure is most evident in the Fall, when it extends downstream along a quasi great-circle route into the western United States. The time series of the WP pattern indicates considerable intermonthly and interannual variability, and persistence of a particular phase of the pattern is relatively common.",

In addition to saving the CO2 emissions (if the H2 is formed from carbon-free energy sources), also the massive energy-related emissions of other compounds like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and soot could be drastically reduced, leading to improvements in air quality (Schultz et al., 2003). Nevertheless, unavoidable leakage in the production, distribution, storage and consumption of H2 could drastically alter the mixing ratio of H2 in the atmosphere. Although it is not a greenhouse gas itself, H2 affects the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane and many other species via its reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical (Schultz et al.,2003). In addition, H2 is an important source for stratospheric water vapor, which provides the substrate for polar stratospheric clouds that play a key role in the formation of the stratospheric polar ozone hole. Therefore, increasing levels of H2 in the atmosphere will counteract the predicted recovery of the ozone hole (Tromp et al., 2003; Warwick et al.,2004; Feck et al., 2008).",

Technically, the SPI is the\r\nnumber of standard deviations that the observed value would deviate\r\nfrom the long-term mean, for a normally distributed random\r\nvariable. Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a\r\ntransformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation\r\nvalues follow a normal distribution.\r\nThe Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly\r\nexpress the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet\r\nconditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other\r\ntime scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to\r\ndecision-makers. Consequently, a separate SPI value is calculated for\r\na selection of time scales, covering the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\r\n9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months, and ending\r\non the last day of the latest month.",

To define the spatial pattern, data are defined over the region (21S-32N, 74W-15E), and spatially smoothed (three longitude by two latitude points). The seasonal cycle is removed, data are detrended, a three-month running mean is applied to the data, and the linear fit to the Cold Tongue Index (a measure of ENSO variability) is subtracted from each spatial point. Spatial patterns are defined as the first left (SST) and right (winds) maps resulting from singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields.

The index was developed through consultation and collaboration with countries, institutions and experts across the globe. This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.\n\nThe reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country’s development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals.",

If it is caused by wind, it is known as krummholz formation, from the German for \u0027twisted wood\u0027.[3]:58\n\nThe tree line, like many other natural lines (lake boundaries, for example), appears well-defined from a distance, but upon sufficiently close inspection, it is a gradual transition in most places.

Greenland, due to having a large and relatively stable deep ice sheet is often the target for drilling ice cores.\n\nIsotopic analysis of the ice in the core can be linked to temperature and global sea level variations. Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.\n\nWhile it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data.

Sea water contains many isotopes of oxygen, the most common being 18O to 16O. During cold periods the glaciers grow, water is drawn up into them, and the proportion of 18O increases. When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive. Using this data a series of at least eleven cycles of cooling and warming climatic conditions have been recognized in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene.",

Whilst a long-term natural process, it may be exacerbated by global warming. This results in a positive feedback effect, as methane is itself a powerful greenhouse gas. The feedback of the undisturbed process is comparably weak, however, because the local release leads to a warming spread over the whole globe.\n\nThe Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane.[1] Global warming may accelerate its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass.[2] Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as submarine clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming.[3][4] Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.[5]",

The increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance the greenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into space and contributing to the warming of Earth\u0027s lower atmosphere. (Earth Observatory) The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations\nfor periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the Antarctic or Greenland ice caps. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO2 levels were about 260¿280uL/L immediately before\nindustrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 years.\nThe longest ice core record comes from Vostok, Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to a depth of 3,600 meters, corresponding to an age of 420,000 years before the present. During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180¿210 uL/L during ice ages, increasing to\n280¿300 uL/L during warmer interglacials.(http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Carbon-dioxide)",

Depending on the temperature of evaporation and how far the water has had to travel before it fell as snow, the ratio of 18O to 16O will vary. This ratio, known as d18O, can be measured very accurately using a mass spectrometer. Over short time scales the change in temperature from summer to winter produces a very clear oscillation in the 18O/16O ratio. This oscillation is used to determine the age of the core at different depths, simply by counting the oscillations. Over longer time periods, this ratio indicates the average temperature of the regions between the evaporation site and the coring site. Investigators in Greenland and Antarctica are also analyzing for the ratio of 1H/2H (Hydrogen to deuterium) which will allow even finer detail about source temperature and condensation history to be obtained.",

For the case of a change in solar irradiance (i.e., \u0027solar forcing\u0027), the radiative forcing is simply the change in the average amount of solar energy absorbed per square meter of the Earth\u0027s area. Since the cross-sectional area of the Earth exposed to the sun (πr2) is equal to 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth (4πr2), the solar input per unit area is one quarter the change in solar intensity. This must be multiplied by the fraction of incident sunlight that is absorbed, F\u003d(1-R), where R is the reflectivity, or albedo, of the Earth, equal to approximately 0.7. Thus, the solar forcing is the change in the solar intensity divided by 4 and multiplied by 0.7.",

It is sufficiently cold for noctilucent (\u0027night shining\u0027) clouds to form in summer, at altitudes around 83 km. \n\nNoctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.\n\nThey are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees. \n\nNoctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.\n\nOne hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.\n\nSubsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nNoctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.\n\nCompeting anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.\n\nThey have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature \u0026/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes.",

PSCs provide surfaces upon which heterogeneous chemical reactions take place. These reactions lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine in the stratosphere which directly destroy ozone molecules.\n\nPSCs form poleward of about 60ºS latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.\n\nType II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83ºC).\n\nThe Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8ºC above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.\n\nDespite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude. The measurements are being used to investigate the climatology of the clouds and their relation to the temperature structure of the stratosphere, and the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and planetary waves in modulating their structure and ozone depletion.",
