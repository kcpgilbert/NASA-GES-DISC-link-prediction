  "Quality" : "The data are provisional and subject to change as model improvements are implemented and new input data sets become available. Due to the fact that forcing data for Greenland are unreliable and the lack of a glacier/ice sheet model, snow water equivalent accumulates indefinitely in Greenland and a few other Arctic points. Therefore it is highly recommended that Greenland and other points with abnormally large snow water equivalent values be masked out when performing global analyses.",

  "Abstract" : "NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2.  GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014.  GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present.  GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are \"open-loop\" (i.e., no data assimilation).  The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.\n\nGLDAS-2.2 is new to the GES DISC archive and currently includes a main product from CLSM-F2.5 with Data Assimilation for the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE-DA) from February 2003 to present.  The GLDAS-2.2 data are available in two production streams: one with GRACE data assimilation outputs (the main production stream), and one without GRACE-DA (the early production stream).  Since the GRACE data have a 2-6 month latency, the GLDAS-2.2 data are first created without GRACE-DA, and are designated as the Early Product (EP), with about 1 month latency.  Once the GRACE data become available, the GLDAS-2.2 data are processed with GRACE-DA in the main production stream and are removed from the Early Product archive. \n\nThis data product is an Early Product for GLDAS-2.2 Catchment Land Surface Model daily 0.25 x 0.25 degree with GRACE-DA. \n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 GARCE-DA product was simulated with Catchment-F2.5 in Land Information System (LIS) Version 7. The data product contains 24 land surface fields from February 1, 2003 to present.\n\nThe simulation started on February 1, 2003 using the conditions from the GLDAS-2.0 Daily Catchment model simulation, forced with the meteorological analysis fields from the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System.  The total terrestrial water anomaly observation from GRACE satellite was assimilated (Li et al, 2019). Due to the data agreement with ECMWF, this GLDAS-2.2 daily product does not include the meteorological forcing fields.\n\nThe GLDAS-2.2 data are archived and distributed in NetCDF format.",
