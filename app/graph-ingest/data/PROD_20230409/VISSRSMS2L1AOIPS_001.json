  "Abstract" : "VISSRSMS2L1AOIPS is the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) Level 1 Atmospheric and Oceanographic Image Processing System (AOIPS) data product from the second Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS-2). There are typically three data files for a scene of the Earth with radiances that were measured in the visible (0.55 to 0.70 micrometer) and/or IR (10.5 to 12.6 micrometer) wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 0.9 and 8 km, respectively. Files also include time, geolocation, orbit, attitude, and telemetry information. There are three types of data files in this product: one contains IR data, one contains the IR grid information, and another contains VIS data. Each data file is structured with an AOIPS label, followed by an IPD label, and then an optional 8 telemetry records followed by a set of data records. Visible data are typically 3904 pixels by either 4000 or 2000 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively). IR data are typically 976 pixels by either 500 or 250 scan lines (5 or 2.5 minute scenes respectively). A full scan of the Earth was made every 20 minutes.\n\nThe data were used to make 70mm film negatives and 9.5‚Äù positive prints on a Dicomed Image Recording System.  Data for this product are available from 1975/04/27 through 1980/08/22 (with gaps plus no data between 1975/07/31 and 1979/05/10). The SMS-2 satellite was initially parked over the equator at longitude 105W on Feb 22, 1975 viewing the hemisphere below the satellite. It was moved to its final operational position at 135W on Dec 19, 1975. The VISSR experiment was operated by the NOAA National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS), as well as scientists from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThis product was previously available from the NSSDC with the identifier ESAD-00095 (old ID 75-011A-04D).",
